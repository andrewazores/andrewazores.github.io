How will my [previous post](/archery/2023/06/12/soft-breakup.html) affect [A3D Archery](https://a3darchery.com), my
tiny home-office based 3D printing business? Long story short, I don't plan for it to have any affect. I will still
shoot, but at reduced capacity, and probably with a different style of bow. I am keeping the printer, I still enjoy
the hobby of 3D printing, and in fact now that I have more time I will probably learn more about 3D design/CAD and find
more problems I want to solve. So if anything, I think this might actually have a net positive effect on the shop.
In any case, rest assured that I intend to keep A3D running. You'll still be able to get your quick fix for affordable,
beginner/intermediate-oriented accessories.
