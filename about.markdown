I am:
- Andrew
- a developer at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com)
- a proponent of [Free and Open Source Software](https://github.com/andrewazores)
- a retired "semi-professional"(?) Team Canada archer
- an on-and-off mentor for (FRC Team 3161)[https://team3161.ca]

These days, I enjoy:
- spending time outdoors, kayaking and camping
- poorly taking photographs

I hope:
- to reduce the suffering of others
- to make a positive difference in the lives of those around me
- to leave all things in a better state than I found them
